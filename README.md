# Automated CI/CD Workflow

This repository contains an automated CI/CD workflow implemented using GitHub Actions. The workflow automates common tasks such as testing, building, deploying, and releasing software projects. It is designed to work with Node.js projects hosted on GitHub.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of the following main steps:

1. **Build and Test**: Checks out the repository, installs dependencies, and runs tests on every push and pull request.

2. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys the application to the production server on every push to the main branch.

3. **Create Release**: Creates a new release in the GitHub repository on every push to the main branch after successful deployment.

4. **Clean Up**: Deletes the branch after it has been merged into the main branch.

## Usage

To use this workflow in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

2. Ensure that your project is set up to run tests and deploy to a production server as specified in the workflow.

3. Customize the workflow to fit your project's specific requirements by modifying the workflow file (`main.yml`) and replacing placeholders with your actual server and project details.

4. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
